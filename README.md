# Java Tabletop Recipe System

The **Java Tabletop Recipe System** is a simple, interactive command-line application designed to explore and showcase a variety of recipes. Built as a learning project for **IS 221: Programming Fundamentals**, it focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and modular design.

## Features

- **Interactive Recipe Selection:**
    - Choose from a variety of recipes, categorized by meal type:
        - **Breakfast Recipes**
        - **Lunch Recipes**
        - **Dinner Recipes**
- **Customizable Recipe Experience:**
    - Filter recipes based on allergies (e.g., dairy, gluten, nuts).
    - Randomly suggest a recipe with a "Surprise Me!" option.
- **Clear Screen Function:**
    - Cleans the terminal screen for better readability between selections.
- **OOP Principles:**
    - Utilizes encapsulation and class abstraction for managing recipe data and game logic.
- **Modular Design:**
    - Easily expandable for adding more recipes or functionality in the future.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Java files:
